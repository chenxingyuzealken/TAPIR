This is a project for Text Analytics for Psychological-Information Research

THe main idea is to aggregate resources here that a computational social scientist might use to analyse psychological aspects within text data. 
Assuming you have a large chunnk of text data that you want to parse, here are some helpful tips for you

Preprocessing, extracting a sample for annotations

Post-processing, Text Summarisation, Time series dashboard
https://github.com/Jcheez/capstone-nlp

Here there are four .ipynb files that can be used for 
   extracting named entities within a text
   doing weak supervision to get emotion and stance labels [I have done it in the fake news detection setting]
   finding the agreement between classifiers
