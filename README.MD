This is a project for Text Analytics for Psychological-Information Research

##MAIN IDEA

The main idea is to aggregate resources here that a computational social scientist might use to analyse psychological aspects within text data. 
Assuming you have a large chunnk of text data that you want to parse, here are some helpful tips for you

##RELEVANT TOOLS

##IPYNB FILES
Here there are four .ipynb files that can be used for: 


extracting named entities within a text

doing weak supervision to get emotion and stance labels [I have done it in the fake news detection setting]

finding the agreement between classifiers

sentence pair classification: given a text and features, predict the subsequent label. In my use case. given a document, a target, the emotion, and the stance, predict if the text is fake news or not
